## Introduction

A music player created using modern web technology,
support multiple devices to sync and manage your own music,
but you need to manually upload your audio

## Motivation

To develop an application using popular technology,
you need to use many third-party libraries and frameworks,
you need to take the time to learn it.

The current web environment is quite different from the past.
High compatibility between browsers(but you still need to pay attention),
also supports es6 modules, and webcomponent.

Can we use the functionality provided by the web to complete an app? let try.

## Scheme

- HTTP2
- ES6 Modules ([jspm](https://jspm.io/))
- JSDoc
- Web Component
- Template engine: [lit-html](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html)(No virtual DOM diffing)
- CSS Variables
